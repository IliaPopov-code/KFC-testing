# KFC-testing
This is a repository for building up on the already existing full-conformal methodology. We present both family of classifiers method and two-class classifier method for full-conformal. 
1. **Family-wise classifier**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   python testing_procedure_family.py
   ```
   In order to produce the results for a synthetic dataset. Hyperparameters are in the header of the file.
2. **Two-class classifier**  
Run:
```bash
python testing_two_class.py
```
Similarly to the previous procedure, hyperparameters are at the top of the file
